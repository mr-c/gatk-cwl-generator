It outputs these\n  counts as well as convenient proportions (such as the proportion of het calls in the EVAL which were called REF in\n  the COMP) and metrics (such as NRD and NRS).\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Input</h3>\n  <p>\n  Genotype concordance requires two callsets (as it does a comparison): an EVAL and a COMP callset, specified via\n  the -eval and -comp arguments. Typically, the EVAL callset is an experimental set you want to evaluate, while the\n  COMP callset is a previously existing set used as a standard for comparison (taken to represent \"truth\").\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  (Optional) Jexl expressions for genotype-level filtering of EVAL or COMP genotypes, specified via the -gfe and\n  -cfe arguments, respectively.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Output</h3>\n  <p>\n  Genotype Concordance writes a GATK report to the specified file (via -o), consisting of multiple tables of counts\n  and proportions. These tables are constructed on a per-sample basis, and include counts of EVAL vs COMP genotype\n  states.\n  </p>\n  <h4>Tables</h4>\n  <p>\n  Headers for the (non-moltenized -- see below) GenotypeConcordance counts and proportions tables give the genotype of\n  the EVAL callset followed by the genotype of the COMP callset. For example the value corresponding to HOM_REF_HET\n  reflects variants called HOM_REF in the EVAL callset and HET in the COMP callset. Variants for which the alternate\n  alleles between the EVAL and COMP sample did not match are excluded from genotype comparisons and given in the\n  \"Mismatching_Alleles\" field.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  It may be informative to reshape rows of the GenotypeConcordance counts and proportions tables into separate row-major tables\n  where the columns indicate the COMP genotype and the rows indicate the EVAL genotype for easy comparison between the\n  two callsets. This can be done with the gsa.reshape.concordance.table function in the gsalib R library.\n  In Excel this can be accomplished using the OFFSET function.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n      <li><i>GenotypeConcordance_CompProportions</i>: Gives the proportion of variants in each category normalized to the total number of called genotypes in the COMP callset</li>\n      <li><i>GenotypeConcordance_Counts</i>: Gives the counts for number of genotypes in each category</li>\n      <li><i>GenotypeConcordance_EvalProportions</i>: Gives the proportion of genotypes in each category normalized to the total number of called genotypes in the EVAL callset</li>\n      <li><i>GenotypeConcordance_Summary</i>: Summary statistics for the sum of all samples and each sample individually.

Were the situation reversed, it would be EVAL_SUPERSET_TRUTH.\n  However, in the case where EVAL has both C and T alternate alleles, both must be observed in the genotypes\n  (that is, there must be at least one of (0/1,1/1) and at least one of (0/2,1/2,2/2) in the genotype field). If\n  one of the alleles has no observations in the genotype fields of the EVAL, the site-level concordance is\n  tabulated as though that allele were not present in the record.\n </p>\n\n  <h4>Monomorphic Records</h4>\n  <p>\n  A site which has an alternate allele, but which is monomorphic in samples, is treated as not having been\n  discovered, and will be recorded in the TRUTH_ONLY column (if a record exists in the COMP set), or not at all\n  (if no record exists in the COMP set).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  That is, in the situation\n  <pre>\n   eval:  ref - A   alt - C   genotypes - 0/0  0/0  0/0 ... 0/0\n   comp:  ref - A   alt - C   ...         0/0  0/0  ...\n  </pre>\n  is equivalent to\n  <pre>\n   eval:  ref - A   alt - .   genotypes - 0/0  0/0  0/0 ... 0/0\n   comp:  ref - A   alt - C   ...         0/0  0/0  ...\n  </pre>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  When a record is present in the COMP set the *genotypes* for the monomorphic site will still be used to evaluate\n  per-sample genotype concordance counts.\n </p>\n\n  <h4>Filtered Records</h4>\n  Filtered records are treated as though they were not present in the VCF, unless -ignoreSiteFilters is provided,\n  in which case all records are used. There is currently no way to assess concordance metrics on filtered sites\n  exclusively. SelectVariants can be used to extract filtered sites, and VariantFiltration used to un-filter them.\n\n <h4>Moltenized tables</h4>\n\n <p>These tables may be optionally moltenized via the -moltenize argument.
