In general, a large percent of regions requiring local realignment are due to the presence of an insertion\n or deletion (indels) in the individual's genome with respect to the reference genome.  Such alignment artifacts result in many bases mismatching\n the reference near the misalignment, which are easily mistaken as SNPs.  Moreover, since read mapping algorithms operate on each read independently,\n it is impossible to place reads on the reference genome such that mismatches are minimized across all reads.  Consequently, even when some reads are\n correctly mapped with indels, reads covering the indel near just the start or end of the read are often incorrectly mapped with respect the true indel,\n also requiring realignment.  Local realignment serves to transform regions with misalignments due to indels into clean reads containing a consensus\n indel suitable for standard variant discovery approaches.  Unlike most mappers, this tool uses the full alignment context to determine whether an\n appropriate alternate reference (i.e. indel) exists.\n </p>\n     <p>There are 2 steps to the realignment process:</p>\n     <ol>\n     <li>Determining (small) suspicious intervals which are likely in need of realignment (RealignerTargetCreator)</li>\n     <li>Running the realigner over those intervals (see the IndelRealigner tool)</li>\n     </ol>\n     <p>\n <p>\n     For more details, see <a href=\"http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id=38\">the indel realignment method documentation</a>.\n </p>\n\n <h3>Inputs</h3>\n <p>\n One or more aligned BAM files and optionally, one or more lists of known indels.\n </p>\n\n <h3>Output</h3>\n <p>\n A list of target intervals to pass to the IndelRealigner.\n </p>\n\n <h3>Usage example</h3>\n <pre>\n java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \\\n   -T RealignerTargetCreator \\\n   -R reference.fasta \\\n   -I input.bam \\\n   --known indels.vcf \\\n   -o forIndelRealigner.intervals\n </pre>\n\n <h3>Notes</h3>\n <ul>\n     <li>The input BAM(s), reference, and known indel file(s) should be the same ones to be used for the IndelRealigner step.</li>\n     <li>When multiple potential indels are found by the tool in the same general region, the tool will choose the most likely\n          one for realignment to the exclusion of the others.
